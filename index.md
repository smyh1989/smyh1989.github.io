## 🌟 About Me

I’m a junior data analyst based in Toronto, transitioning from an education and design background into analytics.  
I enjoy exploring real-world datasets, uncovering patterns, and turning insights into clear, practical recommendations.

I specialize in:

- Cleaning and preparing data  
- Exploratory data analysis  
- Communicating insights clearly and simply  
- Creating reproducible reports using R Markdown  

I’m actively building my analytics portfolio and looking for data analyst or BI opportunities in the GTA or remote-friendly teams.
